### TL;DR

Redesign the “Find a Lobby” page to be visually appealing, modern, and intuitive. The goal is a gamer-first, easy-to-browse, and delightful experience that makes finding and joining lobbies fast and fun. The current version is functional but is visually bland, crowded, and lacks the style or clarity our audience expects.

### Functional Requirements

- Lobby list with sortable and filterable columns (game, owner, mode, rank, party size, region, language, mic required, join method)
- Fast, visible filters at top of the page; sticky if needed
- Distinct visual indicators for public vs private lobbies
- “Join”/“Request to Join”/“Full” actions with tooltips and states (disabled, loading, etc.)
- Gamer profile avatars, game icons, party size indicators, clear readable tags
- Responsive, mobile-adaptive layout

---

### User Experience

- Clear entry point: “Find a Lobby” is easy to access from the main nav
- Filtering should not reload the page; changes are instant
- Visually group or highlight top-rated or recently created lobbies for discoverability
- Friendliness and invitation to join—lobby items should feel clickable, fun, not corporate or plain
- Handle empty states (e.g., no lobbies found, error fetching data)
- Small interactive touches: hover effects, subtle animations for join buttons, readable color contrast
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support for all actions/info

### Narrative

Imagine Alex, a competitive Valorant player, lands on the LFG page. He’s greeted by a bold, visually exciting list of active lobbies, with crisp filters at the top. Each lobby item feels alive—avatar, party size, game icon, quick badges for region and rank. He quickly finds a “Diamond - EU, English” group, sees that his mic is required, and one click later he’s joining the squad. This delightful, fast experience keeps him coming back—and makes him more likely to invite friends.

### Success Metrics

- Page engagement time increases
- “Join Lobby” or “Request to Join” clicks per session increases by 30%
- Lower bounce rate from LFG page
- Fewer user complaints about the UI or findability of lobbies (via support tickets)

---

### Technical/Design Considerations

- Reference leading gaming platform interfaces for polish (Discord, Faceit, etc.)
- Prioritize high legibility, iconic game graphics, clean but rich color palettes
- Use consistent, modern spacing and card/table layout (lean into shadcn and Tailwind patterns)
- Consider component reusability for future tournament/clan listings

# API Security Audit Report - NoobGG

## Executive Summary

The NoobGG API currently has **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** that expose the entire system to unauthorized access and data manipulation. The most severe issue is the complete absence of authentication and authorization on the backend API, despite having authentication implemented on the frontend.

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** üî¥

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. No Backend Authentication (CRITICAL)
- **Description**: All API endpoints are publicly accessible without any authentication
- **Impact**: Anyone can read, create, update, or delete any data in the system
- **Affected Endpoints**: All 62 API endpoints
- **Exploitation Difficulty**: Trivial - requires only basic HTTP knowledge
- **Recommendation**: Immediately implement JWT validation middleware

### 2. No Authorization Controls (CRITICAL)
- **Description**: No role-based access control or permission checks
- **Impact**: Users can modify other users' data, admin functions are exposed
- **Affected Areas**: User profiles, games, events, lobbies
- **Recommendation**: Implement RBAC with proper permission checks

### 3. No Rate Limiting (HIGH)
- **Description**: API has no request rate limiting
- **Impact**: Vulnerable to DDoS attacks, brute force attempts, resource exhaustion
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting middleware (e.g., 100 requests/minute)

### 4. Missing Security Headers (HIGH)
- **Description**: No security headers configured
- **Missing Headers**:
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Strict-Transport-Security
  - Content-Security-Policy
- **Recommendation**: Add Helmet.js equivalent for Hono framework

### 5. Hardcoded CORS Origins (MEDIUM)
- **Description**: CORS origins are hardcoded in source code
- **Current Config**: `["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"]`
- **Impact**: Cannot be changed without code deployment
- **Recommendation**: Move to environment variables

## Vulnerability by Endpoint Category

### User Management Endpoints
| Endpoint | Risk Level | Vulnerability |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| POST /api/v1/user-profiles | CRITICAL | Anyone can create fake profiles |
| PATCH /api/v1/user-profiles/:id | CRITICAL | Anyone can modify any profile |
| DELETE /api/v1/user-profiles/:id | CRITICAL | Anyone can delete any profile |

### Game Management Endpoints
| Endpoint | Risk Level | Vulnerability |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| POST /api/v1/games | CRITICAL | Unauthorized game creation |
| PUT /api/v1/games/:id | CRITICAL | Game data manipulation |
| DELETE /api/v1/games/:id | CRITICAL | Game deletion by anyone |

### Event Management Endpoints
| Endpoint | Risk Level | Vulnerability |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| POST /api/v1/events | CRITICAL | Fake event creation |
| PUT /api/v1/events/:id | CRITICAL | Event manipulation |
| DELETE /api/v1/events/:id | CRITICAL | Event deletion |

## Input Validation Assessment

### Validated Endpoints ‚úÖ
- User profiles (partial)
- Game ranks
- Event invitations
- Languages

### Unvalidated Endpoints ‚ùå
- Games (inconsistent)
- Platforms (missing)
- Distributors (missing)
- Lobbies (missing)

## Security Best Practices Analysis

### What's Done Right ‚úÖ
1. Using Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)
2. TypeScript for type safety
3. Zod schemas for validation (where implemented)
4. Frontend authentication with Keycloak
5. HTTPS support in development

### What's Missing ‚ùå
1. Backend authentication middleware
2. API key management
3. Request signing
4. Audit logging
5. Intrusion detection
6. File upload security
7. Request size limits
8. Environment variable validation

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Data Theft
```bash
# Anyone can dump all user data
curl http://api.noobgg.com/api/v1/user-profiles

# Extract game information
curl http://api.noobgg.com/api/v1/games
```

### Scenario 2: Data Manipulation
```bash
# Delete any game
curl -X DELETE http://api.noobgg.com/api/v1/games/123

# Modify user profiles
curl -X PATCH http://api.noobgg.com/api/v1/user-profiles/456 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "hacked"}'
```

### Scenario 3: Resource Exhaustion
```bash
# No rate limiting allows unlimited requests
while true; do
  curl -X POST http://api.noobgg.com/api/v1/games \
    -d '{"name": "spam"}'
done
```

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Do Now)
1. **Implement Authentication Middleware**
   ```typescript
   app.use('/api/v1/*', authMiddleware);
   ```

2. **Add Rate Limiting**
   ```typescript
   app.use(rateLimiter({ 
     windowMs: 60000, 
     max: 100 
   }));
   ```

3. **Validate All Inputs**
   - Add Zod validation to all endpoints
   - Implement request size limits

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (This Week)
1. Add security headers
2. Implement RBAC
3. Add audit logging
4. Set up monitoring alerts
5. Create security documentation

### Phase 3: Advanced Security (This Month)
1. Implement API versioning strategy
2. Add request signing
3. Set up intrusion detection
4. Conduct penetration testing
5. Implement security training

## Compliance Concerns

### GDPR Violations
- No access controls on personal data
- No audit trail for data access
- No encryption at rest mentioned

### Security Standards
- Does not meet OWASP API Security Top 10
- Would fail PCI DSS compliance
- Does not follow security best practices

## Recommendations Priority Matrix

| Priority | Task | Impact | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| P0 | Add backend auth | Critical | Medium |
| P0 | Implement rate limiting | High | Low |
| P1 | Add input validation | High | Medium |
| P1 | Security headers | Medium | Low |
| P2 | Audit logging | Medium | Medium |
| P2 | RBAC implementation | High | High |
| P3 | API monitoring | Medium | Medium |
| P3 | Security testing | Medium | High |

## Conclusion

The NoobGG API is currently in a critically insecure state. The complete lack of backend authentication means that all data is publicly accessible and modifiable. This represents an unacceptable security risk that must be addressed immediately before any production deployment.

The frontend authentication with Keycloak provides a false sense of security, as the backend does not validate these tokens. This architectural mismatch must be resolved by implementing proper JWT validation on all API endpoints.

**Recommendation**: Halt all feature development and focus on implementing the Phase 1 security fixes immediately. The system should not be deployed to production or exposed to the internet in its current state.
